# jetpack-weather-api

Jetpack Weather App is an Android application developed in Kotlin that allows users to check the weather forecast for different cities. The app fetches weather data from the WeatherAPI service using the provided API key. Users can view the current weather conditions as well as the forecast for the next few days.

## Features
• Current Weather: The app displays the current weather conditions for the selected city, including temperature, condition, and an icon representing the weather.

• Weather Forecast: Users can view a 3-day weather forecast for the selected city. Each day includes the date, maximum and minimum temperatures, condition, and a weather icon.

• Tabbed Interface: The app uses a tab layout to switch between an hourly forecast and a daily forecast.

• Search City: Users can search for a specific city to get the weather forecast. The app provides a dialog for entering the city name.

• Sync Data: Users can manually trigger a data refresh to update the weather information for the selected city.
